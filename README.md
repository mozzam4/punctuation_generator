# punctuation_generator

This repo is about a simple Neural Network Model that puts punctuation such as ('.', '?', '!') in the text without punctuation. 
By running get_model_punctuation.py we get the text with punctuation from a trained model. 


To train this model again with addtional Punctuation follow the google colab repo below.

To run the model. Need to download glove 6B vector with 100 dimention. and changes of file paths need to be made in get_model_punctuation.py.
